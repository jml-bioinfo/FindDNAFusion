# findDNAFusion
a pipeline combining multiple software tools for the deteion of cancer-associated gene fusions in Next-Generation DNA Sequencing

FACTERA, JULI anf GeneFuse were selected and optimally configured in the pipeline to support a list of target fusion genes in solid tomor panel
for the analysis of multiple samples simultanesously.
