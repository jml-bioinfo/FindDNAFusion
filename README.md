# findDNAFusion
A pipeline combining multiple software tools for the deteion of cancer-associated gene fusions in Next-Generation DNA Sequencing

FACTERA, JULI and GeneFuse were optimally configured in the pipeline to support a list of target fusion genes (36 clinically 
relvant fusion genes) in solid tomor panel for the analysis of multiple samples simultanesously.
